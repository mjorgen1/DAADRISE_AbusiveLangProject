Abusive language detection is a difficult task for comment moderators. Machine Learning has shown promising results in detecting abusive language online. We aim to explore an underdeveloped field of Automated Machine Learning (Auto-ML) for text classification with the application of abusive language detection on Twitter. We utilize an English data-set (from Davidson et. al) and a German data-set (from Wiegand et al.). We propose Automated Machine Learning with multi-class classification as an approach to abusive language detection online.

We owe a great deal to Davidson et al. (data and code) and Wiegand et al.'s (data) work. We extended Davidson's code here by adding H2O-Auto-ML, German language functionality for pre-processing and feature extraction, and feature selection and undersampling methods.

## Execution
To execute the German run, go to /H2o-Work/Germ_H2OAutoML-ULTRA.ipynb and you can see comments relating to feature selection algorithms and undersampling techniques. You can choose which methods you would like to run by commenting out the ones you do not want and uncommenting the ones you would like to use. Further, you will have to save the German data-set from Wiegand et al.'s GitHub and update your folders in the code. Then you can run the Jupyter Notebook. 

To execute the English run...
